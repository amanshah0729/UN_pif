Article 13 of the Paris Agreement established the ETF, which aims to increase the ambition and reporting requirements for all signatory Parties to the Agreement. At the 24th Conference of Parties held in Katowice in 2018, countries agreed on modalities, procedures, and guidelines (MPGs) for the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), which come into effect in 2024. Under the Paris Agreement and the MPGs, all Parties are required to prepare and submit biennial transparency reports (BTR), which should include an updated national inventory of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, information on progress towards achieving their nationally determined contribution (NDC), and information on support needed and received for climate actions. Additionally, under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, each Party should, as appropriate, submit and periodically update an adaptation communication as a component of or in conjunction with other communications or documents. Biennial transparency reports are to be reported every two years, while NDC shall be revised every 5 years enhancing the ambition of the previously submitted NDC. Furthermore, Parties of the Paris Agreement shall report National Communications (NCs) every four years, and all Parties are encouraged to submit low-carbon long-term strategies to set the national vision for achieving the objectives of the agreement. This information requirements present a challenge to all countries, especially to those that, due to their geographic and or economic reality, already face the strongest impacts of climate change.

Over 2.5 million smallholder farmers depend on rain-fed agriculture, making food systems especially sensitive to climate variability. Coastal areas like Accra, Takoradi, and Ada are increasingly affected by erosion, saltwater intrusion, and displacement.

While this demonstrates The Country’s ability to mobilize climate finance, the reports acknowledge critical gaps in tracking disbursements, effectiveness, and alignment with NDC targets. There is no system for aggregating climate-related financial flows from development partners, nor is there a methodology to capture in-kind support, technical assistance, or capacity-building in a structured manner. Support needs assessments are also lacking, particularly at the sector level, making it difficult to establish a coherent and evidence-based resource mobilization strategy."

Key barriers identified include weak knowledge of funding opportunities, poor coordination among institutions, limited tracking of expenditures, and the absence of standardized reporting mechanisms. The MoF, NDPC, and EPA operate separate systems with different data formats, reporting cycles, and priorities. Sector ministries and MMDAs are not systematically involved in tracking or reporting climate-related support, despite being responsible for implementing many NDC actions. Technical tools like CLIMFINTRACK currently focus on public expenditures and do not capture off-budget climate finance or support received by CSOs, the private sector, or academia. As a result, The Country lacks a centralized, consistent, and policy-relevant view of support flows, which undermines its capacity to plan, budget, and report under the ETF. EXAMPLE END."

This weakens the feedback loop between transparency and implementation, reducing the impact of climate information on real-world outcomes. The lack of institutional ownership and mainstreamed use of transparency findings across the policy landscape undermines [Country]’s ability to align its national development priorities with its climate commitments. Strengthening internal capacity, operationalizing the national transparency platform for dual reporting and planning functions, and embedding transparency workflows into regular government systems are therefore essential for long-term sustainability and compliance with ETF obligations.
