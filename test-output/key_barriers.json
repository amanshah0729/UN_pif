This weakens the feedback loop between transparency and implementation, reducing the impact of climate information on real-world outcomes. The lack of institutional ownership and mainstreamed use of transparency findings across the policy landscape undermines [Country]’s ability to align its national development priorities with its climate commitments. Strengthening internal capacity, operationalizing the national transparency platform for dual reporting and planning functions, and embedding transparency workflows into regular government systems are therefore essential for long-term sustainability and compliance with ETF obligations.
