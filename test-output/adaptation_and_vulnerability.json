These risks threaten livelihoods, health, and food security—particularly for women, smallholder farmers, and low-income communities. The Country’s Updated NDC (2021) outlines 13 adaptation actions across seven priority sectors and highlights the need for a robust MRV system to track adaptation progress under the ETF."

It launched the The Country Climate Ambitious Reporting Programme (CARP), which primarily focused on mitigation but included pilots for adaptation MRV in the agriculture and water sectors. CBIT 1 also supported the integration of climate indicators into The Country’s medium-term development planning and collaborated with the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) to align sectoral indicators with climate outcomes. However, as highlighted in the CBIT 1 Terminal Review, these efforts were not sustained or scaled across other sectors, leaving adaptation MRV systems underdeveloped."

Vulnerability and adaptation data are scattered across institutions, inconsistently collected, and often lack disaggregation by gender, location, or sector. Many baseline datasets are outdated or unavailable, limiting the ability to evaluate progress or inform decision-making. These data gaps reduce The Country’s ability to attract adaptation finance and demonstrate results."

While the EPA, NDPC, and select ministries have climate-focused staff, technical knowledge of adaptation MRV tools and methodologies is limited. CBIT 1 training efforts were narrow in scope and not sustained. Capacity is particularly weak at subnational levels, despite the growing role of local governments in NDC and NAP implementation. Limited funding, high staff turnover, and lack of dedicated MRV tools undermine continuity and institutional memory."

Without addressing these challenges, The Country’s adaptation tracking and transparency will remain limited and disconnected from broader national planning efforts. EXAMPLE END."
