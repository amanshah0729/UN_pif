Describe what would happen without this project (simple future narratives). What are key drivers that would maintain the status quo (or make it worse)? E.g. population growth, economic development, climate change, socio-cultural and political factors, including conflicts, or technological changes. i.e. based on existing trends, the country would continue to not report in accordance with the ETF. Drivers are important as we have to respond to these in the description of the project]"

The country experiences distinct dry and wet seasons, with regional disparities in rainfall. Northern The Country faces prolonged droughts, while southern and coastal regions experience heavy rainfall, flooding, and sea-level rise. Over 2.5 million smallholder farmers depend on rain-fed agriculture, making food systems especially sensitive to climate variability. Coastal areas like Accra, Takoradi, and Ada are increasingly affected by erosion, saltwater intrusion, and displacement. Land degradation, deforestation, and rising temperatures threaten ecosystems and rural livelihoods. Rapid urbanization and inadequate infrastructure further increase exposure to climate risks, affecting energy systems, water supply, housing, and health."

Its First National Inventory Document (NID) reported 2022 emissions at 54,758.55 ktCO₂e (including LULUCF). The energy sector was the largest emitter (45.1%), followed by agriculture (21.2%), waste (17.8%), LULUCF (12.4%), and IPPU (3.5%). Total emissions rose by over 214% between 1990 and 2022, driven by energy demand, urbanization, transport, and industry. Energy sector emissions grew by 754%, while agricultural emissions tripled, driven by methane from livestock and rice, and nitrous oxide from fertilizer. Urban waste emissions also rose due to poor landfill practices and open burning."
